# mc-home-server
Tools for hosting a Minecraft server at home.

# Getting Started
First, install a Linux distribution on the server. A headless [Debian install](https://www.debian.org/distrib/) is recommended to use minimal computer resources. Once the OS is installed, set up the server with a static IP address (a tutorial for that can be found [here](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/set-static-ip-address-debian-server/)) so that the IP address clients will connect to doesn't change.
